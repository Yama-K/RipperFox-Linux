# RipperFox Linux

### 🦊 RipperFox is a self-hosted Firefox extension and local backend combo that lets you download videos, GIFs, and images directly from websites using your own machine and **yt-dlp**.   No trackers, no third-party servers, and no dependency on any online service — everything runs locally.
