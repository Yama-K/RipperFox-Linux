# RipperFox Linux

### 🦊 RipperFox is a self-hosted Firefox extension and local backend combo that lets you download videos, GIFs, and images directly from websites using your own machine and **yt-dlp**.   No trackers, no third-party servers, and no dependency on any online service — everything runs locally.

⚠️ Important

RipperFox consists of two parts:

The Firefox extension, which adds right-click download options.

The local backend, which must be downloaded and running on your machine for the extension to work.

The extension cannot function without the backend.
You can get the latest backend release and setup instructions right here in this repository.

## ✨ Features

- Right-click → **“RipperFox Download”** on almost any link, image, or video.
- Automatic format conversion via `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`.
- Per-site output folders and custom arguments.
- Backend built in **Python + Flask**, portable and self-contained.
- Works completely offline once set up.
